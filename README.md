Python 3.6

This script attempts to graph a logarithmic line of best fit for compensation of professional coders across number of years of experience as well as by varying level of educational attainment. I wrote this because I was curious about what evidence there is for obtaining various levels of education in computer science. It considers only professional coders who reported their compensation and years of experience to Stack Overflow and who are paid in USD, and work in the United States.
